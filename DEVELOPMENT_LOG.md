## 2025-07-14: Implement Fruit Picking Mission

- **Objective**: Create the core logic for a fruit picking and sorting task.

- **Actions Taken**:
  - Created a new ROS package `fruit_picking_mission` in `mission_ws/src/mission/`.
  - Defined a ROS Action `PickFruit.action` to handle the asynchronous picking task. The action goal is the `fruit_type` (string) and it returns a `success` boolean.
  - Implemented the main control node `mission_manager.py` inside the new package. This script includes:
    - An Action Server to receive picking goals.
    - A subscriber for fruit detection messages (`/obj_dets`).
    - Placeholder logic for calling arm and servo services.
    - A dictionary `bucket_positions` to map fruit types to the servo's rotation angle for sorting.
  - Updated the main `README.md` file to include detailed documentation about the new `fruit_picking_mission` package, its architecture, and how to run it.
